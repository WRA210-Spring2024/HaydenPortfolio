                The screen responds with climbing stats
                The cries of the planet are felt
                Through a deadly earthquake, crushing homes
                
                The screen just shows me climbing stats
                A demon charged into a school
                Like a deadly earthquake, crushing hearts
                The arrows severed minds too soon
                
                The demons charge into our schools
                Burning truth and closing doors
                These arrows severed minds too soon
                Before they could learn to open their arms
                
                Hiding from truth by closing my doors
                I’d add a point to a different graph
                Before they would know to open their arms
                My friends would find that I am gone
                
                Another point, a different graph
                The news was rather grim today
                My friends say hi yet I’m almost gone
                I only stare with hardened eyes
